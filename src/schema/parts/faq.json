        "text": "<p>When it comes to choosing the best small breed, it depends on what you\u2019re looking for in a canine companion.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe all have different lifestyles, preferences and temperaments,\u201d says Dr. Cheri Honnas, D.V.M., veterinary advisor to <a href=\"https://bonevoyagedogrescue.com/\">Bone Voyage Dog Rescue</a>, a non-profit that rescues dogs from Mexico and finds them homes in the U.S. and Canada.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe key is to identify a breed that aligns with your lifestyle and resonates with your personality,\u201d Honnas adds.</p>\n<p>Most dog experts and veterinarians recommend you ask yourself the following questions before choosing a particular breed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the main reason you want to add a dog to your life?</li>\n<li>What is your experience with dogs?</li>\n<li>What is your lifestyle like? Are you active or more sedentary?</li>\n<li>Do you have other people living with you? Any children? Any other animals?</li>\n<li>Do you live in an apartment or a house with a big backyard?</li>\n<li>Are you looking for a high-energy breed or a relaxed dog?</li>\n<li>What level of grooming do you want to commit to?</li>\n<li>What is your budget for veterinary care?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to research what the dog was originally bred to do, says Stefanie Strackbein, owner of What Dogs Want Academy and a certified family dog mediator based in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>\n<p>\u201cNot every Dachshund will see every garden, flower pot and bed cover as the perfect place to dig, but do not be surprised if they do (because Dachshunds&#8217; original job was to\u00a0hunt badgers by crawling into their burrows),\u201d Strackbein says.</p>\n"

        "text": "<p>Whether your dog is gentle will depend on temperament, but don\u2019t rule out the importance of socialization, training and the amount of affection and interaction the dog receives, Hauser says.</p>\n<p>That being said, there are some dogs that are generally recognized as being more gentle and affectionate, including the Maltese and pugs.</p>\n<p>Again, it\u2019s important to do your homework, Strackbein says.</p>\n<p>\u201cToy dogs were bred to be attentive and gentle with their people but they can become possessive and be less gentle with other people or animals,\u201d she adds.</p>\n"
